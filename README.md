# Game Description

The game is built using Processing. 
The player can obtain points by clicking on the cats as fast as they can 
without clicking on the dogs that randomly appear on the screen. 
The game also has a time limit and clicking on dogs will decrease their time 
whereas clicking on 'super cats' will increase the time left to play the game.
